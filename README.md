# Comedy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/untu/comedy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/untu/comedy)

Comedy is a Node.js actor framework.

Actors are all about flexible scalability. After describing your application
in terms of actors, you can scale arbitrary parts of the application to multiple cores on a
single host (by spawning sub-processes) or even to multiple hosts in your network by simply
 modifying the configuration and without changing a single line of code.

## Installation

Comedy is installed with NPM by running:

    npm install comedy
    
After that you can use Comedy framework in your code by requiring `comedy` package.

    var actors = require('comedy');
    
## Quick Start

Running your first actor is as simple as follows:

```javascript
var actors = require('comedy');

var actorSystem = actors(); // Create an actor system.

var myActorPromise = actorSystem
  .rootActor() // Get a root actor reference.
  .then(rootActor => {
    return rootActor.createChild({ // Create a child actor that says hello.
      sayHello: to => {
        console.log(`Hello, ${to}!`)
      }
    });
  });

myActorPromise.then(myActor => {
  // Our actor is ready, we can send messages to it.
  myActor.send('sayHello', 'world');
});
```
    
This will print

    Hello, world!
    
along with some other log messages from a created actor system.

So, the steps required to create and run a minimal actor are the following:

1. *Create an actor system.* You would normally do that in your main (startup) script. There is
a bunch of options that you can pass when creating an actor system, and these options will
be discussed in later sections. For now, we'll be just using the defaults.
2. *Get a reference to a Root actor.* Actors can only be created by other actors, so you need
an initial actor to start from. This actor is called a Root actor, and you can get it from
actor system by using `rootActor()` method. The method returns not the actor itself, but
a Promise of the Root actor. To get an actual reference, we use `Promise.then()` method.
(Comedy uses a [Bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/) promise library. For more information 
about promise API, please refer to
[Bluebird documentation](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api-reference.html)).
3. *Create your actor as a child of a Root actor by using `createChild()` method.*
This method takes an actor definition as a first argument. An actor definition describes
a behaviour of an actor: it defines what messages an actor can accept and how does it respond
(message handlers) as well as how an actor is initialized and destroyed (lifecycle hooks).
Actor definition can be represented in several formats. In our example, we're using a plain object
actor definition with a single message handler, that handles `sayHello` message. It awaits a 
single `to` argument, prints a message to console and does not respond anything.
